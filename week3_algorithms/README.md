## Description
The **sorted** folder contains files to the [sort](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2024/spring/psets/3/sort/) exercise. This folder doesn't contain code files, but a series of output files related to different sorting methods. The methods are merge sort, selection sort and bubble sort. The problem was to figure out what files are related to each method, and the answers are registered in the file answers.txt\
The **plurarity** folder contains files to the [plurarity](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2024/spring/psets/3/plurality/) exercise. This exercise implements a voting system where the user defines how many voters there is and each voter can vote for only one candidate. The output is who won the election.\
The **runoff** folder contains files to the [runoff](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2024/spring/psets/3/runoff/) exercise. This exercise implements a voting system similar to plurarity, but each voter defines their first vote option, then the second vote option, until the it runs out of candidates.
