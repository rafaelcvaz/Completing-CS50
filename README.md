# Completing the CS50 Course

> :construction: Project in progress :construction:

## Description
Hello, my name is Rafael Vaz. I'm a Biological Sciences student in Brazil changing areas to programming. I have some experience in bioinformatics, but only simple concepts that I want to develop.
I'm completing the [CS50 course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2024/spring/) in this repository to help me focus and learn the basics of programming. Most of the codes provided in this repository are pre-made by the CS50 team, and planned so the students taking the course can contribute with specific functions to complete the code.
This experience is also helping me to lear how to use Github, and I'm organizing the materials in diferent weeks, each one with a specific theme. The codes are very simple and made for educational purposes.
