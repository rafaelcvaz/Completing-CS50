# Completing the CS50 Course

> :construction: Project in progress :construction:

## Description
Hello, my name is Rafael Vaz. I'm a Biological Sciences student in Brazil changing areas to programming. I have some experience in bioinformatics, but only simple concepts that I want to develop.
I'm completing the [CS50 course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2024/spring/) in this repository to help me focus and learn the basics of programming. Most of the codes provided in this repository are pre-made by the CS50 team, and planned so the students taking the course can contribute with specific functions to complete the code. This experience is also helping me to learn how to use Github.\

## Organization
I'm separating the materials in different weeks, each one with a specific theme. The codes are very simple and made for educational purposes, each week has a problem set with a few exercises. The folders for each week contain other folders relative to these exercises.\
The problem sets of week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4 and week 5 are all C codes. After week 5, the CS50 course suggests other programming languages like Python (as the name of each week suggests).
